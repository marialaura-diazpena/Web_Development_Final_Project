# Web_Development_Final_Project
(School project) Final Project for Website Development

Part 1: Using JSON, this website searches for an employee from the file 'employeedata.json'. You can search by last name, by id and by address.

Part 2: Using the 'finalquiz.xml' file, this website displays a quiz and the grade and score obtained when completed.

Part 3: Using the 'rentalclients.json', I created a website for 'Dodgy Brakes Car Rental' company. This website takes you to the rental page where you can search for a client's name and book a car to rent.
